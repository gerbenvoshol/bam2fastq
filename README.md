bam2fastq
=========
    
bam2fastq is a program to extract sequences and qualities from a BAM file.

The original version can be found [here](http://gsl.hudsonalpha.org/information/software/bam2fastq).
It has subsequently been modified to handle BAM files with mixtures of paired and unpaired reads and write to stdout.
